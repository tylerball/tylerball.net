Years ago Apple [added the "Album Artist" field to iTunes][itunes7], immediately solving the problem of grouping albums containing tracks with featured artists. For metadata anal-retentives like myself certain albums (rap mixtapes, collaborative albums, split singles) live in this grey area between single-artist albums and compilations. Just because _[I Got That Work][igtw]_ has a featured artist on almost every track does not make it a compilation—it's decidedly a work of Big Tymers—_[Psych Funk 101][pf101]_ is a compilation.

Album Artist works great for this, but unfortunately doesn't work on any of the iPod Classics, which I use in my car, so albums formatted this way clutter the artist list with an entry for [every combination of featured artist][applsupport]. My solution is to move featured artists out of the Artist field and into the Track Name.

So I wrote a [JXA script][jxa] to make this easier:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tylerball/62e2d072dce0da725fd4.js"></script>

### To install:

1. Open Script Editor (`/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app`)
1. Create `~/Library/iTunes/Scripts` if it doesn't exist.
1. Copy the code into a new Document. Make sure that the `JavaScript` script language is selected:

    ![script type](<%= blog_file('scripttype.png') %>)

1. Save it as an `Application` File Format in that scripts folder.

### To use:

1. Select some tracks in iTunes and select start the script from the ![script menu](<%= blog_file('scripticon.png') %>) in the menu bar.
1. The script will prompt you for a [Regular Expression][regexp] with which to strip out the featured artist and move it to the Artist field. It's prefilled with [beets][beets]' default syntax.

    ![Regex](<%= blog_file('regex.png') %>)

1. Behold your manageable iPod.
