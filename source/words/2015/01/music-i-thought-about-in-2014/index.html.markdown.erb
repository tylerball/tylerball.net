I was going to just list some stuff like I have [done][2013] before but _wow nobody cares_. Here is some music I've thought about a lot in 2014.

ILoveMakonnen - "Down 4 So Long" (YouTube)

"Tuesday" is great, a perfect party hook, but it's not exactly deep. But take a look at his work in the years prior and his strength as a songwriter, producer and performer is obvious. Above is the best example: a simple instrumental with somewhat plain lyrics is shot into the stratosphere on a completely unreserved, emotive performance.

Rich Gang - "Lifestyle" (Cash Money)

Young Thug. _Young. Thug_. A year of vocal performances that completely overshadow anyone in the vicinity: "Stoner", "Danny Glover", "About The Money", "Dresser" and this; a celebration of all things good. Thugger is in his finest form, taking about 90% of vocal duties, filling in all the gaps with a grand palette of ad libs like he's the Michael Winslow of rap.

Warpaint - _Warpaint_ (Rough Trade)

A quiet, beautiful record I keep returning to when being quiet.

Chief Keef - "No" (Glo Gang/Glory Boyz)

The best outcome of Chief Keef getting dropped from Interscope is that a lot of the music held up by the label is being "released" (does Youtube count?) and can finally be heard. Since _Finally Rich_ Keef has doubled down on experimentation: autotune, deleting drums, layered vocals, atmosphere. There's no sound better than an artist working exactly how they want to, no more, no less. I could've picked any of [his uploads][keef] for a standout track.

Dean Blunt - _Black Metal_ (Rough Trade)

I can't think of a better reflection of the paranoia this year hath brought than _Black Metal_. Injustice so stark and bright in our faces, agony of powerlessness despite all moral compasses pointing in your direction. There isn't a year end list without reference to grand juries and I guess this one does too.

Blunt has a million influences in his recipe but the result has all influence distilled away. A "cover" of ["Ain't Worried About Nothin"][worried] so delicate and hesitant perhaps the opposite is true.

The literature around Dean Blunt paints him as paranoid, rejecting the connectivity that defines our lives, performing antagonistically to the audience; backlit with bodyguard. Hands up. Don't shoot.
