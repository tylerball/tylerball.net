I can't stop watching these videos. They succinctly illustrate the present era
a of participatory media better than anything else I've seen; how social media
encourages us to make an event out of everything. They are the last grasps at gender
rigidity and the internal combustion engine.

Let's begin with a simple example of the genre:

What a way to combine your love of your toys and your children into a simple
video to share with friends and family. Lest you think that this is a party
with only trucks, you can announce your offspring's genitalia with a burnout on
your motorcycle too:

It could even gain you a mention on your local network affiliate for "going
viral".

Why stop at indoctrinating your child into your love of trucks and impart a
political orientation?

This one is like the _Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon_ of truck exhaust gender
reveals. It's a pastoral static shot of blue powder falling in slow motion from
the pipes of a huge semi.

Sometimes it doesn't seem to go well at all. This one is so low-key its
depressing; no cheering, no fanfare. Do these people even care about their
baby's gender or what?

More recent videos introduce a lot of production value. With this one they
either found a cousin who owns a DSLR, gimbal and is a bit dangerous with Adobe
Premiere, or they brought in Robert Zemeckis.

I'll leave you with the first one I saw and still the best, for reasons that
will be self-evident:
