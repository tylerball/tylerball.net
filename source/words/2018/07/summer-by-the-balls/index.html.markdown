Oh yeah every year I say I'm really gonna squeeze all the juice out of the
summer but this year I'm _really_ gonna do it. There will be a smoking hole in
the earth where this summer once was.

Usually by the end of September I feel some malaise and regret that I was
inside a little too much, left a Corona undrank and a lake unswam. Not this
year.

People will be filled with reverence and envy as they remember Summer 2018 as
that one When He Really Did It. That year when he was pure expression of
relaxation and warm weather exuberance in the face of all adversity.
