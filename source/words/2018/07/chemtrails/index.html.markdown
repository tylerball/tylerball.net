I think about conspiracy theorists a lot, [reading][jz] about them when I can.
Obviously there's some degree of grifting going on, but it's near impossible to
get them to fess up. People in sales talk about believing in what you're
selling, but do they? Neocon pundits are similar, do they believe in the march
towards hypercapitalism so strongly that they ignore the heat-death of the
universe at the expense of it?
