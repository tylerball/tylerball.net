What if we hired a small child by the hour to kick everyone in the shins? They'd
do it at a totally unpredictable interval so you could never know when it's
coming. We should probably hire one to hide under every desk.

"What am I doing wrong?" You shout down to your ankles, beyond the mug that
reads <small>DO WHAT YOU LOVE</small>. The kid says something about Fortnite and ignores
the question.
