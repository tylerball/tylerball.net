While I don't mind the TTC, I have always preferred my bike, maybe most in the
winter. Bundled in a parka on a packed, stuffy streetcar is no fun and on
stormy days delays can make my commute almost 90 minutes. By bike it's about 30
minutes all year round.

But without the proper equipment it can be miserable. I've tried a lot of
different bikes, clothing and accessories over the years for usually what
amounts to ~10 months of riding a year. This year I've refined it to a setup
that works for me 365 days a year.

### the bike

First, the bike. There are two things that make a huge difference: tire diameter
and disc brakes. After hardheadedly riding road bikes and fixed gears in the
fall and giving in when the snow starts to fall, I decided I should treat
myself to some real traction.

Skinny tires are fine eight months of the year in the city but the minute there
is snow on the ground it's time to look at tires 30c and larger with tread
designed for those conditions. You may even want to consider studs, as
the City of Toronto's intepretation of snow removal isn't so much a "removal"
as a "push to the gutter where the cyclists are and hope for the best" I like
the [Schwalbe Winter K-Guards][tires].

Disc brakes are worth it in the snow, as the temperature in
Toronto usually means "slush" which can build up between your fork and
seat-stays, bogging down rim brakes.

Beyond these two things the bike doesn't really matter. Gravel bike, mountain
bike, whatever. My approach was to buy a used [Norco Indie 3][indie] from
Kijiji and switch it to drop bars for an imitation gravel bike.

### full coverage fenders

I don't have specific product recommendations here because the best fender seems to
vary a lot from bike-to-bike but fenders that reach over the rear wheel closer
to the ground are essential. Snow sticks to your tires more easily than rain
and can spray your back if your fenders aren't long enough.

### bar mitts

[These things][mitts] are the most effective way to keep your hands warm. I've tried
many types of gloves, but once the temperature drops below about -10Â°C they all
stop keeping my hands warm. Bar mitts give you a wind break that creates a
pocket of warm air in front of your hands. Pair them with a thinner inner glove
and you also have the benefit of better articulation for braking and shifing
compared to big lobster gloves or mittens.

### boots

I've worn regular non-cycling boots with flat pedals and straps or cages (I
like my feet connected to the pedals) but I've found this combo can effect the
circulation in my feet and make my toes cold quicker. These [Fizik X5
][fizik] SPD-compatible boots are the best option I've seen in terms of
waterproof performance.

### pants

On days where good fenders don't protect you (like it's actively snowing or
raining) you need pants. I've bought every rain pant at MEC and they are all
terrible, with nonsensical fit and excessive material in the wrong places.
These [Endura pants][pants] are bulky enough to wear over street clothes but not too
bulky that they get caught in your drivetrain. They also have pockets and
ventilation, which are not always a given with cycling pants.

### lighting

With shortened days, good lighting is a requirement. The [Cygolite
Metro][cygolite] headlight strikes the right balance between price and
brightness. It's lowest setting is enough to ensure you're seen in clear
conditions and it's bright settings are plenty for flooding an unlit bike path.

### layering

Above the waist the best approach is to have options. I ride at a pace
that a good rain jacket over a t-shirt keeps me warm down to near freezing as
long as my extremities are protected. Below that I will add fleece and thermal
base layers as necessary. Uniqlo Heattech is great and cheap.
