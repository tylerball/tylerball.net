Previously: [2014](/words/2015/01/01-music-i-thought-about-in-2014) and [2018](/words/2019/12/12-music-i-thought-about-in-2018).

It's embarrassing to care about something as pointless as a list of the albums
a website thought were the best of the last decade. Is ten years even a
meaningful way to group time to represent an era of society? Pitchfork, now
owned by Conde Nast, is not what it used to be. No longer is it a publication
for people (white men) who cared too much about music to bitch, make tastes and
have fun with the stale format of music criticism. Now it's a place to shore
up a milquetoast consensus and publish inexplicable sponsored content.

But we repentant music nerds love lists. It's how we organize our feelings
about music into coherent statements, and whether I like it or not that
website's lists helped shape my tastes and identity. But what is the statement Pitchfork has
chosen to make with [their decade end list][pf4k]? To me it reads like they're
mostly just trying to cover their own asses.

Here are fifteen albums not on Pitchfork's top 200. With the exception of
_Yeezus_, _Take Care_, _Channel Orange_ and _Black Messiah_ (15th, 13th, 10th
and 9th on their list) I enjoyed these more than their top 15.
