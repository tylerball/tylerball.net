      <p>We landed in Tokyo in the evening, right off the subway into the
      crowds of Shibuya. Through the crossing to meet up with our friend Adam,
      who happened to be in town for work at the same time, staying in an
      Airbnb in the exact same building.</p>
      <p>He led us to a jazz bars, a smoky izakaya and good cafes throughout
      our time together. He helped us ease into an unfamiliar city.</p>

      This year we decided to challenge ourselves. Last year we only had one portage at only 100 or so metres; it meant we could pack as much as we wanted, for it was simple to make multiple trips from one lake past some rapids down to the river below. We’d heard good things about Misty Lake, but getting there required a 20 km paddle with six portages varying from 150 metres all the way to a kilometre. Multiple trips on a portage of that length could eat up a half hour or more of our travel day. Single trips would take some serious packing skills.
